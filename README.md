# Image-Generation-using-GANs
Generative Adversarial Network which is popularly known as GANs is a deep learning, unsupervised machine learning technique which is proposed in year 2014.
The main blocks of this architecture are:

Generator : This block tries to generates the images which are very similar to that of original dataset by taking noise as input. It tries to learn the join probability of the input data (X) and output data(Y); P(X|Y).

Discriminator : This block tries to accept two inputs, one from main dataset and other from images generated from Generator, and bifurcates them as Real or Fake.

To make this Generative and Adversarial process simple, both these block are made from Deep Neural Network based architecture which can be trained through forward and backward propagation techniques.

The generator generates a "fake" sample given a random vector/matrix, and the discriminator attempts to detect whether a given sample is "real" (picked from the training data) or "fake" (generated by the generator). Training happens in tandem: we train the discriminator for a few epochs, then train the generator for a few epochs, and repeat. This way both the generator and the discriminator get better at doing their jobs.
